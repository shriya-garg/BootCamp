IMPLICIT WAIT

The implicit wait will tell to the web driver to wait for certain amount of time before it throws a "No Such Element Exception".
The default setting is 0. 
Once we set the time, web driver will wait for that time before throwing an exception.

Syntax:
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

EXPLICIT WAIT (+ expected Conditions)

The explicit wait is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or the maximum time exceeded before throwing an "ElementNotVisibleException" exception.
The explicit wait is an intelligent kind of wait, but it can be applied only for specified elements. 
Explicit wait gives better options than that of an implicit wait as it will wait for dynamically loaded Ajax elements.
Once we declare explicit wait we have to use "ExpectedCondtions" or we can configure how frequently we want to check the condition using Fluent Wait. 

Syntax:
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriverRefrence,TimeOut);

The following are the Expected Conditions that can be used in Explicit Wait
